    <h2>Things I learnt about Vim this week: Joining lines of text.</h2>
</div>
<div>
    
    <p>I've been using Vim now for <a href='http://www.markwoodhall.com/2014/11/13/thoughts-9-months-after-switching-to-vim/'>over a year</a> but I'm still increasingly amazed how little I know.</p><p>This week I've been writing some documentation in markdown. Working with text that isn't a programming language like C#, Clojure or JavaScript helped me to discover a few cool Vim commands I should have known already.</p><h3><a name="joining&#95;lines&#95;of&#95;text"></a>Joining lines of text</h3><p>Given the following block of text, when the cursor is on the first line we can use <code>J</code> in normal mode to join the two lines of text.</p><pre><code>this is a line of text
and should be followed by this
</code></pre>becomes<pre><code>this is a line of text and should be followed by this
</code></pre><p>With text spread over three lines, like below, when the cursor is on the first line we can use <code>JJ</code>  in normal mode to join the three lines of text.</p><pre><code>this is a line of text
and should be followed by this
and this
</code></pre>becomes<pre><code>this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this
</code></pre><p>Obviously, we can do better than bashing the <code>J</code> key. Lets take the below text as an example. Vims composability means that <code>J</code> is just another command we can apply to word motions, or selections. With the cursor on the first line of the text we can do <code>VGJ</code>. <code>V</code> goes into Visual mode, <code>G</code> selects to the  bottom of the document and <code>J</code> joins the selection.</p><pre><code>this is a line of text
and should be followed by this
and this line

this is a line of text
and should be followed by this
and this line

this is a line of text
and should be followed by this
and this line

this is a line of text
and should be followed by this
and this line
</code></pre>becomes<pre><code>this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line
</code></pre><p>Thats pretty cool, since we can apply <code>J</code> to selections we can do more too. If we take the text block below, when the cursor is on line 3, we can enter visual mode <code>V</code>, select 2 lines down <code>2j</code> and hit <code>J</code> to join the selection.</p><pre><code>this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line

this is a line of text
and should be followed by this
and this line

this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line

this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line
</code></pre>becomes<pre><code>this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line

this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line

this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line

this is a line of text and should be followed by this and this line
</code></pre><p>We can apply the same principle using something more concrete as an example. What if we had the <code>if</code> statement below and we'd rather just put the condition checking on one line. With the cursor positioned on the opening parentheses we can hit <code>V%J</code>, <code>V</code> to go into Visual mode, <code>%</code> to select to the closing parentheses and <code>J</code> to join the text.</p><pre><code>if &#40;1 == 1 &amp;&amp;
    2 == 2 &amp;&amp;
    3 == 3&#41; {

}
</code></pre>becomes<pre><code>if &#40;1 == 1 &amp;&amp; 2 == 2 &amp;&amp; 3 == 3&#41; {

}
</code></pre><p>Note that <code>J</code> joins lines and includes an additional space between them. To join lines without the inclusion of an additional space you can use <code>gJ</code>.</p><p>A quick mention to a Vim plugin I was using when editing markdown. <a href='https://github.com/shime/vim-livedown'>vim-livedown</a> uses a node module called livedown to preview markdown files in the browser as you edit them.</p>
