    <p>TL;DR</p><p>I wrote a small validation library for Clojure and ClojureScript. It's "alright" and it's called <a href="https://github.com/markwoodhall/clova" shape="rect">clova</a>, I'd appreciate any feedback over on <a href="https://github.com/markwoodhall/clova" shape="rect">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>Recently I came across <a href="http://jen20.com/2015/02/08/event-sourcing-in-go.html" shape="rect">a blog post</a> by <a href="http://www.jen20.com" shape="rect">James Nugent</a> that described some example patterns for implementing event sourcing in Go. I'm no expert, I've not studied much Go code before and I've never written any but I'd certainly have to agree with the observation James made, there is much less code than some C# implementations.</p><p>James made available the <a href="https://github.com/jen20/go-event-sourcing-sample" shape="rect">code</a> for his post on GitHub, so I thought it would be interesting to have a look and come up with a Clojure implementation based on the same domain. I'd suggest reading James <a href="http://jen20.com/2015/02/08/event-sourcing-in-go.html" shape="rect">post</a> as this one will follow the same structure.</p>

    <p>I've been using Vim now for <a href="http://www.markwoodhall.com/2014/11/13/thoughts-9-months-after-switching-to-vim/" shape="rect">over a year</a> but I'm still increasingly amazed how little I know.</p><p>This week I've been writing some documentation in markdown. Working with text that isn't a programming language like C#, Clojure or JavaScript helped me to discover a few cool Vim commands I should have known already.</p>

    <p>I've described <a href="http://markwoodhall.com/2014/11/13/thoughts-9-months-after-switching-to-vim/" shape="rect">previously</a> how I've been trying to improve my tooling and move away from using GUI tools so much. As well as this I've also had a more general move away from Windows to OSX.</p><p>Since I'm spending most of the day doing Windows based development on the .NET Framework there are a couple of tools I keep using in a VM. I've managed to get rid of most of these but I've not really found a good replacement for SQL Server Management Studio. There is <a href="http://razorsql.com/" shape="rect">Razor</a> but I'm not very into that.</p>
