I'm Mark, a passionate, 31 year old software developer based in the West Midlands, England. I've spent the last 10+ years developing using C# on the .NET framework.

In that time I've used a range of technologies while continually learning and improving as both a developer and a team member.

Software development is a hobby as well as a profession and I spend a lot of time working on side projects and sometimes contributing to open source projects.

While I think its important to have a deep understanding of the languages and tools you use, I think it is equally, if not more important to have good problem solving and team work skills. I pride myself on collaborating with team members across the development lifecycle and enjoy getting things done.

I like to go to local user group sessions when I can and attend at least 1 conference a year. Last year was the brilliant [DDDX](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6453-ddd-exchange-2015) and [FPX](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7036-functional-programming-exchange-2015).

When I'm not developing or learning new skills I enjoy ultra running, spending time with my family and getting outside.

# Experience

### [ByBox](http://www.bybox.com)
#### Software Developer
#####June 2013 to present

ByBox manages more dropboxes than any other company in the UK, and delivers over 20 million parcels a year.  My role at ByBox involves working in a distributed, remote development team to constantly improve the technology platform and therefore the services offered to customers.

We develop and maintain a large number of discrete components designed in an SOA style. We employ TDD where appropriate with a focus on writing understandable and readable code.

### [Avelo/IRESS](http://www.iress.com)
#### Software Developer
#####May 2012 to June 2013

Avelo/IRESS is a market leading provider of end to end financial services software solutions.  My role within the company involved designing and developing software systems to enable the financial industry to work in a more cost effective, efficient manner.

I worked on a number of key projects for the company and was part of an agile team working to the principles of Kanban.  I led a number of TDD developments and provided help and mentoring to other staff members where appropriate.  Using previous experience of TDD I was able to guide members of the management team and start refactoring a legacy code base toward a more modern one that reflected the TDD effort.

Working with the Project Manager to promote user story and acceptance criteria based features enabled a purer TDD approach to be taken with tests that could genuinely drive product development. In many scenarios this was taken a step further since with direct involvement from customers a BDD approach started to naturally appear.

As well as development using the familiar microsoft stack, I also had the experience of developing what was the companies most popular and well received iOS app as well as the supporting infrastructure and back-end services.
