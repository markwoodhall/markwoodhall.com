There appears to be a never ending stream of content out there these days about the demise of .net and
the difficulties of .net core adoption. I think we could be about to hit a turning point, with the recent
[1.1.1 release](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/1.1.1-download.md) and 
new tooling support in Visual Studio 2017 everything is starting to come together. I don't use Visual Studio much
but the tooling in Visual Studio Code is just as good, it's a pleasure to use at the moment. 

Many people I've spoken to about starting to use .net core have cited a lack of adoption in the community and
particularly third party library authors as reasons to defer their own usage. In this series of posts
I aim to highlight an awesome library that already has .net core support, every day, for 15 days.
