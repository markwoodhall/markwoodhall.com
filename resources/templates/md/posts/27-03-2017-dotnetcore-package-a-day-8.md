### Overview

This post is part of a series, dotnet core package a day, where for 15 days I will be posting an overview of an awesome OSS dotnet package that already has support for dotnet core. In this post we will cover [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR).

> Simple mediator implementation in .NET
>
> In-process messaging with no dependencies.
>
> Supports request/response, commands, queries, notifications and events, synchronous and async with intelligent dispatching via C# generic variance.

MediatR is relatively young and is gaining in popularity. At the time of writing it has 223,592 downloads on NuGet. The publish of it's v2.1.0 release to NuGet on the 1st July 2016 added support for dotnet core (.net standard 1.1).

MediatR development is led by [Jimmy Bogard](https://twitter.com/jbogard), there have been at least 20 contributions from the wider community as well.
